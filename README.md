# picking_game
The game requires a working copy of relion 1.4.  It will look for the hardcoded path in line 8, change this to the correct path, if it doesn't find relion there it will ask for the location every time.

- after starting the game select the micrograph to work on
- pick the particles on the micrograph that appears, right click and save the star file
- hit enter on the window running this program to display the score and display the diagnostic
- enter you name and email (optional) to get all the glory

to add your own micrographs:
- put the micrograph in the micrographs folder
- use relion to pick particles to make the answer, save the star as micrographs/<filename>_answers.star
